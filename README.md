# Features

<!-- The Connect 4 Command Line Interface game was created to produce a retro style, immersive experience through the use of limited design (due to the nature of Python) and site structure. It has a game like structure with the use of screens and user input to navigate from one screen to another. -->

## Navigation

![Menu example of 4 options]()

  * The program's navigation is done mainly via the use of on screen menus and user input to navigate from one screen to another
  * For the most part the menu is dictated by numbers e.g. Press 1) To Get Started ...
  * The user input is handled so as to prompt the users of the correct input needed to move to the screen of choice if an incorrect input is entered.


## Welcome Screen

![Welcome Screen]()

  * The welcome screen is the first screen the user will see when they run the program.
  * Figlet fonts are used to create the wordle title banner that displays in yellow.
  * This banner is also displayed across multiple other screens throughout the program for consistency.
  * The user is greeted by a message explaining the program and explaining how to input values
  * Through the use of print statements and user input, the user can navigate to the Get Started screen or the Rules screen.
  * The user input is validated before proceeding to the next screen.

## Game Rules

![Game Rules screen]()

  * The Game Rules screen can be accessed by the user from the Welcome Screen via user input of '1'.
  * Figlet font is used to display the title banner of Game Rules in a red colour to distinguish it from the main title banner.
  * A timed scolling up, line by line text goes through the rules of the game in yellow.
  * The information about usernames is in a red font so as to stand out as important information.

  ![Important info in red]()

  * Once the end of the rules is reached, user input is required to move on, allowing the user to scroll back and read the rules in their own time if need be.
  * Once the user input is validated the user is brought to another menu, allowing the user to choose to go back to the Welcome Screen or move ahead to the Get Started screen.
  * This user input is also validated before allowing the user to move ahead.

## Create Username/Login

![Create Username/Login page](docs/images/create-username-login-screen%20-p1.png)

* The get started, one must either create a username or login and this screen can be reached via the Welcome screen and user input ('2') or the Game Rules screen and user input('2')
* The screen itself has the signature Connect 4 title banner in yellow on top.
* Player 1 always starts and is prompted via a user input on whether they would like to create a username('1') or login('2').
* This input is validated.

### Create Username

![Create username screen]()
  
  * If the user decides to create a username, they are then prompted to input a username of choice.
  * This input is first converted to all capitals for consistency and to prevent two different usernames such as 'Rhi' and 'rhi' existing.
  * This also future proofs logins for users if they decide to play again, as any mistypes in terms of capitilisation are handled by converting the input to all capitals, avoiding the user potentially mistakenly logging in with someone elses username.
  * Using the .replace() method the user input for username removes any blank spaces from the input so as not to throw an error when appending to google sheets as blank space is translated differently there.
  * The user input is then validated so that:
    1. The length of the string(user input) is not empty
    2. The username itself is between 2 and 10 characters
    3. The user cannot input a username that is already saved in Google Sheets
  * Once the input passes validation, there username is saved in Google Sheets and their Total Wins and Total Loss values are set to 0.
  * The user is greeted with a personalised screen, stating their name, what player they are and what their player piece is and the string is in red for player 1 and yellow for player 2.

  ![Create username validated]()

  * Once Player 1 has input their details, Player 2 is then brought to the same initial on screen menu as player one and if they choose to create a username as well they go through the same steps as player 1.

  ### Player Login

  ![Player login screen](docs/images/p2-login.png)

  * If the user decides to Login, they are then prompted to enter in their username.
  * This input is then first converted to all Capitals in case a user mistypes re capitilisation.
  * The input value is then checked against the usernames already in Google Sheets and if it is there, it will pull that players data into the game and 'log' them in.
  * If it isn't there, the user will be prompted with a message saying Cannot find username and the user can re-enter their username.
  * If Player 2 decides to log in there is an extra step; their input is validated by the above steps but it also checked against Player 1's Username.
    * If it matches the user will be prompted with a message, stating user already logged in, to prevent the same user logging in twice
    * If it doesn't match and the input value found in Google Sheets, then the player data is pulled in for that user and the player 'logged' in.
  * Once validated the username value is matched with that on google sheets and the relevant data pulled into the program; The user's Total Win history and Total Losses history to be displayed when playing the game.
  * The users are greeted with a personalised screen, the same as when a user creates a username

  ![Player login success]()

* Once the username data is all validated and the data pulled into the game the users are brought automatically to the next screen which is the start screen.

## Start Screen

![Player start screen]()

* The start screen is only accessed in two situations; 
  1. When the users first create usernames/login
  2. Or when the users finish a game and decide to play again they are brought directly to this screen.
* The user is prompted with a message asking them if they are ready and to press 'C' to continue.
* The user input is validated and if passed, gives a countdown of 3, 2, 1 before disappearing and 'PLAY' appears on the screen and the user is brought to the game screen.

## Game Screen

![Game Screen]()

* The game screen consists of 3 parts;
  1. The game bar on the top
  2. The 'Game Board' itself
  3. The text for user input and information

  ### Game Bar

  ![Game Bar]()

  * The Game bar consists of a number of strings printed together consisting of 
  blank strings and text, with a text highlight (from termcolor and colorama libraries) on all the printed strings to give the illusion of a rectangle.
  * The bar itself has two sets of info on it;
    1. That for the current game which consists of the stats(Player 1s wins and losses and player 2s wins and losses for their game agains each other)
    2. And the history of games played of the two players(Player 1s total wins and losses from whenever the have played the game, and similarly the same for Player 2. )
  * Once a game is won, the game bar is updated immediately and visibly at the end of the game. 
  * The game bar is also utilised in the high scores screen to give the scores related to the current users as well as the verall top scores.

  ### Game Board

  * The game board is a representation of the classic connect 4 game, but larger.
  * It is created through various empty strings and character strings.
  * Visually it looks like a large rectangle split into columns and rows.
  * When a player piece is dropped into the board, like the classic game it fills the next available blank spot to the corresponding column picked.

  ### Player information area

  ![Player 1's turn](docs/images/p1-drop-piece.png)
  ![Player 2's turn](docs/images/p2-drop-piece.png)

  * All player input, error handling and information is printed below the game board.

* Player 1 always starts and is prompted to choose a column between 1 and 10 via user input.
* This input is validated:
  1. To check if the column is free first and if its full it lets the user know and asks them to pick a different one.
  2. To make sure the input they entered is a number and if not prompts the user to make the correct choice
  3. To make sure if the user input is a name, that its between 1 and 10 and if it isn't to prompt the user to make the correct choice. 
* If it passes the player piece (which is a unicode image of a red disc for Player 1 and a yellow disc for Plyer 2), is placed in.
* After every move, the board is checked for a 'win', if there is 4 particular characters in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
* If not the next player goes and if so the game board is updated with the new results, the players are let know who won.

![Player won the game](docs/images/Player2-winner.png)
* The board isn't wiped immediately allowing the user's to see the winning play.
* To move on requires the user input of 'C' to continue which is validated and if it passes the user continues on to the Play Again screen.
* A tie is also possible, and if all the spaces are filled in the board, the game finishes with the declaration of no winner and the user can continue on to the play again screen.

## Play Again

![Play Again Screen](docs/images/play-again-screen.png)
 
* The play again screen is the screen the user is taken to after they finish a game of connect4.
* From here they are faced with four choices, chosen via user input:
  1. Play Again
  2. Go Back to Welcome Screen - which resets the players without closing the program
  3. Go to the High Scores screen
  4. Exit Game
* Option 1, brings the user straight back to the start screen in a loop, there scores are still present for the current game, te user names are all set and their overall stats are updated no matter how many games they play in the loop.
* Option 2 brings the users back to the welcome screen - effectively resetting the users, allowing for new users to log in and play without exiting the program. Any scores they received in their previous game will have been saved to their overall stats via google sheets and their current game scores will be reset.
* Option 4, takes the users to the high scores screen.
* Option 5, allows the users to exit the program.
* The user input is validated making sure only numbers 1-4 can be selected to progress.

## High Scores Screen

![High Scores Screen](docs/images/high-scores-screen.png)

* High Scores screen can only be accessed from the play again screen (option 3)
* It consists of the game bar on top - the same as that when the game is running
* And the top 5 high scores, sorted by the number of winds in desscending order in table form
* To exit this screen the user must press c to continue.
* The input is validated and if passed brings the user back to the play again screen.

## Quit Screen

![Exit Screen](docs/images/exit-screen.png)

* The exit screen can only be acessed from the play again screen (option 4)
* This shows the user a goodbye message before exiting the program

# Future Features

## Timer

The timer would add an extra bit of challenge to the user experience and definitely worth implementing as a future feature. Details of the logic flow of the timer can be seen in the [Flowchart](<#flowchart>) section above but it wasn't implemented in the end due to time constraints.

## Single Player Mode

A mode where the user plays against the computer would add a better user experience to the game and appeal to a wider range of people.

## Important Note & Update Security

* Please note that the use of the username only as a system to login is a security risk as players need only see their opponents username and could potentially login as that user. This was done purely to show input error handling while dealing with two different inputs one after the other, and storing and retrieving values associated with those inputs.

Ideally a password would also be used to authenticate a users login, as well as an email address  associatet with the username for retrievals. This could most definitely be a future update but for the moment, the storage of potentially sensitive data was being avoided without some sort of consent from the user and better security.

## Username Flexibility

At the Login section for users, if the user cannot remember their username there is no option to go back to create a username or retrieve a username. This is an important feature to have for better user experience

## Profanity Filter

Make use of a profanity filter when creating usernames.

# Data Model

Google Sheets was used to store all the data for the Connect 4 CLI application. Data was sent to and retrieved from it. The google sheet had a singular worksheet which stored all the data. Usernames stored any users created and their relevant stats, linked to their username via columns; their total wins ever at the game and total losses ever at the game.

![Google sheets](docs/images/google-sheets.png)

## Bugs Fixed

<details><summary>Bugs Fixed info</summary>

### Adding Data to Google Sheets via Gspread

When initially adding users to Google sheets using the append_row method, there was an invalid data values. Upon research on the use of gspread, it was realised that the data that was being appended was not in a list format. To remedy this, the .split() was used initially.

![Google spread error]()

But later, that was changed to where the list was added directly in the append_rows statement and as the code was being refactored to make it more efficient by setting the data values of the other two columns at the same time rather than in a different statement.

![Fixed using split method]()

![Refactored more efficient code]()

### Logic Error When Dealing with Two Usernames

A logic error occured when the creation of the usernames weas initially coded. It occured when Player 1 creates a new username or logs in, it allowed Player 2 to log in with the same username.

![Double player login]()

To fix this, Player 2's username input had an additional comparison element to it, comparing it to Player 1 ... and if true, it would report an error to the user that the username was already logged in ... and if false it would allow Player 2 to log in.
[Back to top](<#contents>)

![Double player login fix]()

### Blank Space in Username & Blank Username

User create name and login seemed to be working well, however an error was found when the user entered any blank spaces in their username, whether this was at the beginning of the input or a 2 or 3 word input or just blank spaces for the username.

![Error returned if username is all blank spaces]()

To fix this, the .replace(' ', '') function was used to replace all the white space with a string without any. A string was also added to let the user know when creating their username, that any blank space would be removed from the username.

![Blank space in username bug]()

![String added to let user know blank spaces would be removed]()

To catch the username adding just blank spaces as a username, another comparison was added to the validate_player_name function which checks the users input string length and if it is equal to 0 (blank space) then it would return an error to user and reinitiate the input.

## Terminal Compatibility

This project is intended to be used and deployed via Heroku, and the terminal template given to us. Therefore this project was created with that fact in mind. It is not recommended to use this project on a local terminal as certain display positioning would be off, even if the functionality of the game would still be working.
